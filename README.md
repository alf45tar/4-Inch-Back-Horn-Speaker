# 4" Back Horn Speaker Fully Printable
My version of a 4" back horn speaker using the script to generate a customisable back horn speaker enclosure from
[Chris Hill](https://www.printables.com/model/117883-customisable-back-horn-speaker-enclosure/files).

The shape of the waveguide is a close copy of [guppyk2](https://www.thingiverse.com/guppyk2/designs)'s [4" back horn V2 design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4750820).
